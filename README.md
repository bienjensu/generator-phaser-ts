Provides a handy jumpstart for a [Phaser][phaser] project with a
[TypeScript][typescript] codebase.

<img src="screenshot.jpg" alt="Demo game screenshot" width="100%">

In addition to a ready-to-code scaffolding, you get
stuff like:

- A fully-functional Phaser project, complete with TypeScript type definitions
- Automated tasks for compiling, bundling, and deploying
- A demo game to get you going
- A [Heroku][heroku] deployment setup

## Requirements

Thereâ€™s two things youâ€™re gonna want to have installed globally before you run
this generator:

- [Yarn][yarn]
- [Typings][typings]

Of course, youâ€™ll also need [Node.js][nodejs] and [Yeoman][yeoman], but you
already knew that, yeah?

## Installation

    $ yarn global add generator-phaser-ts

Thatâ€™s it.

### Caveats

If the above installation command yields unsatisfactory results, give npm a crack
at it, i.e. `npm i -g generator-phaser-ts`.

If Yarn yells at you about the installation of anything, you may need to install
the current stable version, (at the time of writing) 0.16.1. If youâ€™re using
Homebrew, youâ€™ll need to make sure youâ€™ve checked out the proper version of the
Yarn formula. In my case, this did the trick:

``` shell
$ cd /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core/Formula/
$ git checkout ca1c753c6df92e46962c14b01e597c60fc299c5c yarn.rb
$ brew install yarn
$ git checkout HEAD yarn.rb
```

## Usage

    $ yo phaser-ts
    
This gets a project scaffolded out, installs software requirements, and does
an initial build of the included demo game.

**PRO TIP:** Create a new directory for your game and `cd` to it before running
the generator.

## Development

This project uses [gulp][gulp] to automate various common development tasks. While
you can interact with gulp directly, the generator gives you access to some scripts
that should cover your day-to-day needs.:

- `gulp lint`: Processes all .ts files in the src directory with `tslint` and
  displays the results
- `gulp build`: Compiles all .ts files in the src directory; outputs .js files
  to the build directory
- `gulp bundle`: Concatenates all .js files in the build and lib directories
  into a single file: public/js/bundle.js
- `gulp compress`: Uglifies the bundled .js file; outputs public/js/bundle.min.js
- `gulp watch`: Watches for changes to source files; when a change is detected,
  rebuilds files and reloads the website.
- `gulp deploy`: Deploys to Heroku. See below.
- `gulp`: The default gulp task. Runs the `bundle` task.

For convenience, this project includes a basic Node.js application that serves
up your game courtesy of the [Express][express] framework. To start the Express
server, run `yarn server`. You should now be able to see your game running at
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

If you would like to run the server as well as rebuild your files upon save, i.e.
what youâ€™ll be doing most of the time, run `yarn devel`.

**PRO TIP:** If you want to run the server but *not* rebuild files upon save, set
the `LIVERELOAD` environment variable to `0`: `LIVERELOAD=0 yarn devel`.

## Deployment

Included is a Heroku-compatible [Procfile][heroku-procfile] soâ€”assuming
you have the [Heroku Command Line Interface][heroku-cli] installed and youâ€™re logged
inâ€”getting your game up on them internets should be as simple as:

    $ yarn deploy

**PRO TIP:** You can `yarn production` to locally serve your game using minified code.
